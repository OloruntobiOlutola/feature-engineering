and multiples of the pivot columns that are on their left: The second col-

The key idea for finding the solutions of Ax= 0 is to look at the non-
pivot columns, which we will need to express as a (linear) combination of
the pivot columns. The reduced row echelon form makes this relatively
straightforward, and we express the non-pivot columns in terms of sums
and multiples of the pivot columns that are on their left: The second col-
umn is 3 times the first column (we can ignore the pivot columns on the
right of the second column). Therefore, to obtain 0, we need to subtractour lives easier when we need to determine a particular solution. To do
this, we express the right-hand side of the equation system using the pivot
columns, such that b=
P
i=1 λipi, where pi, i = 1,...,P, are the pivot
columns. The λi are determined easiest if we start with the rightmost pivot
column and work our way to the left.
In the previous example, we would try to find λ1,λ2,λ3 so that
λ1

From here, we find relatively directly that λ3 = 1,λ2 =−1,λ1 = 2. When
we put everything together, we must not forget the non-pivot columns
for which we set the coefficients implicitly to 0. Therefore, we get the
particular solution x= [2,0,−1,1,0]⊤

Remark (Reduced Row Echelon Form). An equation system is in reduced row-echelon form (also: row-reduced echelon form or row canonical form) if
It is in row-echelon form.
Every pivot is 1.
The pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.

The reduced row-echelon form will play an important role later in Sec-
tion 2.3.3 because it allows us to determine the general solution of a sys-

performs elementary transformations to bring a system of linear equations
into reduced row-echelon form. ♢
